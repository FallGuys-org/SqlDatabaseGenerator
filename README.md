# Fall Guys SQL Database Generator
![Build status](https://github.com/FallGuys-org/SqlDatabaseGenerator/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)

This tool generates a SQL database from [the Fall Guys database](https://github.com/FallGuys-org/TheDatabase).

For now, it can output a SQLite database only.

## Usage
Just run the app. The default behaviour is to load data from the Fall Guys database repo and generate a SQlite database named `fallguys.db` in the same folder as the app.

Run the exe with `--help` to read the docs and see all options.
